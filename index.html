	<h2>About Raleigh, NC</h2>
<p>Raleigh, the capital city of North Carolina, is one of the South’s most vibrant, eclectic cities – where eclectic meets traditional and historic meets modern. Centrally located along the USA's eastern coast, the city forms part of North Carolina’s famed Research Triangle, a wellspring of education, research and technical innovation. You’ll discover outstanding arts and culture (earning the city the nickname “Smithsonian of the South”), a renowned culinary landscape (including the James Beard Foundation's 2019 Best Chef in America, Ashley Christensen) and a music scene that inspired “Rolling Stone” to call Raleigh one of the top eight emerging music cities in the USA.

	<h3>Eats on Eats</h3>
<p>You won’t go hungry (or thirsty) in Raleigh. Start at Brewery Bhavana, where you’ll not only find a Belgium-inspired brewery, but also a dim sum restaurant, community library, bookstore and flower shop all in one. Traveling with picky eaters or just can’t decide what to eat? Head to Morgan Street Food Hall or Transfer Co. Food Hall, where you can please every palate with eclectic food choices ranging from tacos and fresh seafood to bagels and gourmet ice cream. When happy hour hits, pick from more than 350 beers on draft at Raleigh Beer Garden, claiming the largest draft selection in the world. International restaurant favorites include Garland (try the Cauliflower 65 with turmeric-yogurt sauce) and Laotian fare at Bida Manda (the crispy pork belly soup is outstanding).</p>
